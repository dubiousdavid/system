# system

Start and stop services in a particular order.

Based on ideas from [component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component). Differences from component:

1. No need to explicitly define dependencies for a particular service.  Simply order the services in the system map to facilitate dependency needs.
2. Configuration is first-class. To start the system or a particular service, a config value must be passed.  This allows you to start/stop a system using a development or production config in a functional way.
3. Easy initialization of services using init1, int2, â€¦

## Installation

```clojure
[system "0.1.0"]
```

## How to use

Example scenario:
```clojure
(use 'system)

(defrecord LDAP [conn]
  Service
  (start [this config deps]
    (->LDAP (ldap/connect (:ldap config))))
  (stop [this config]
    (->LDAP (ldap/close conn))))

(defrecord MySQL [conn]
  Service
  (start [this config deps]
    (->MySQL (mysql/connect (:mysql config))))
  (stop [this config]
    (->MySQL (mysql/close conn))))
    
(defrecord HTTP [server]
  Service
  (start [this config deps]
    (let [routes (mk-routes (:ldap deps) (:mysql deps))]
      (->HTTP (http/start (:http config) routes))))
  (stop [this _]
    (->HTTP (http/stop server))))

(defsystem system
  :ldap (init1 LDAP)
  :mysql (init1 MySQL)
  :http (init1 HTTP))
  
(def config
  {:ldap {:host "localhost" :port 389}
   :mysql {:host "localhost" :port 3306}
   :http {:port 80}})
  
(def started (start system config))
(stop started)
```
